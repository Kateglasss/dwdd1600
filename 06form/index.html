        <h1>Our Story</h1>

        <h2>Where It All Began</h2>
        <p>At Rooted Grace Apothecary, our journey began with a simple belief: that true wellness grows from the ground
            up. Inspired by natures wisdom and the traditions passed down through generations, we set out to create an
            apothecary that honors the past while serving the present.</p>
        <p>What started as a handful of herbal blends and handcrafted tinctures has grown into a mission to reconnect
            people with the healing gifts of the earth. Every formula is made with care, intention, and respect for the
            plants that sustain us.</p>

        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>We believe wellness should feel approachable, beautiful, and deeply nourishing. From soothing teas to
            balancing tinctures, every product is designed to bring calm, vitality, and harmony to everyday life. Our
            name, Rooted Grace, reflects our foundation: rooted in the earth, guided by grace in the way we care for
            ourselves, our community, and our planet.</p>

        <h2>Nature Meets Nurture</h2>
        <p>Each creation is crafted in small batches with ethically sourced herbs, pure ingredients, and mindful
            formulations. We are passionate about sustainability, honoring both the people we serve and the land we draw
            from. This is more than an apothecary—it is a celebration of slowing down, breathing deeply, and returning
            to the essentials.</p>
        <p>Welcome to Rooted Grace Apothecary, where nature and nurture meet, and where every product tells a story of
            care, connection, and timeless tradition.</p>
