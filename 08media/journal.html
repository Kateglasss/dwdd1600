            <h2>The Calming Power of Lemon Balm: An Herb for Mind and Spirit</h2>

            <p>At Rooted Grace Apothecary, we're always exploring the ways herbs can gently support everyday wellness.
                Today, we want to shine a little light on one of our favorite plant allies: <strong>lemon balm</strong>
                (<em>Melissa officinalis</em>).</p>

            <h3>A Gentle Healer Through History</h3>
            <p>For centuries, lemon balm has been treasured by herbalists across Europe and the Mediterranean. Known as
                the <em>“gladdening herb”</em>, it was often used in teas, tinctures, and balms to uplift the heart,
                ease nervous tension, and promote restful sleep. Monks even grew it in monastery gardens to help soothe
                weary travelers.</p>

            <h3>Why We Love Lemon Balm</h3>
            <p>This cheerful, lemon-scented plant is more than just fragrant—it’s a powerhouse for the nervous system.
                Modern herbalists often recommend lemon balm for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Calming occasional anxiety or restlessness</li>
                <li>Supporting focus during stressful days</li>
                <li>Easing digestion when tension knots the stomach</li>
                <li>Promoting gentle, natural sleep</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bringing Lemon Balm Into Your Day</h3>
            <p>Here’s a simple way to enjoy the benefits of lemon balm in your daily routine:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Steep 1–2 teaspoons of dried lemon balm leaves in hot water for 10–15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Breathe deeply and enjoy the uplifting citrus aroma.</li>
                <li>Sip slowly, allowing the calming properties to ease your body and mind.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>It also blends beautifully with chamomile, lavender, or peppermint for a custom herbal infusion. At
                Rooted Grace Apothecary, we use lemon balm in several of our calming blends because it reminds us of
                what wellness should feel like: gentle, joyful, and rooted in nature.</p>

            <h3>A Note of Mindful Use</h3>
            <p>While lemon balm is considered safe for most people, always listen to your body and consult with a
                qualified practitioner if you’re pregnant, nursing, or taking thyroid medication. Herbs work best when
                paired with awareness and care.</p>
